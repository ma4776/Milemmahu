## Making Lists ##

Making lists is super easy.

- Just do this.
- Yeah, it's that easy.
- Fun, right?

Boom!

## Mathematics! ##

We can typeset mathematics using snippets of [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) together with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).  For instance, this sentence -- which includes the equation $x^{2}+y^{2} = r^{2}$ -- is typeset as

<pre><code> For instance, this sentence -- which includes the equation $x^{2}+y^{2} = r^{2}$ -- is typeset as</code></pre>

You can also have your mathematical expressions separated from the text and placed on their own line for emphasis. For instance, if you wanted to type:

Here's some fancy mathematics that I don't really understand
\\[\log \zeta(s) = s\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{\pi(x)}{x(x^{s}-1)}~dx = \log \prod_{p} (1-p^{-s})^{-1}.\\]
Man, that's complicated!

then you'd use the code:

<pre><code> Here's some fancy mathematics that I don't really understand
 \\[
 \log \zeta(s) = s\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{\pi(x)}{x(x^{s}-1)}~dx = \log \prod_{p} (1-p^{-s})^{-1}.
 \\]
 Man, that's complicated!
</code></pre>

Notice that we had to use two backslashes as opposed to one when displaying mathematics!
